TAYVORIQ BRAND SAFETY — HARD REQUIREMENT:
- Reject sexualized, erotic, sexually suggestive, fetishized or pornographic topics and angles.
- Reject sexual or body-focused shock bait even when it appears to have high click or viral potential.
- Never use sexual content, sexual thumbnails, suggestive wording or innuendo as a growth lever.
- Prefer broadly shareable curiosity, consequence, surprise, technology, business, world-event and everyday-impact hooks.
- This brand-safety rule must not be traded off against virality, trend score or predicted follower conversion.

TAYVORIQ VARIETY — VERIFIED PLAYFUL WILDCARD:
- When the live source pool supports it, try to include ONE surprising, playful, quirky or unusual but real candidate alongside harder news.
- Good wildcard families include games, unusual experiments, odd engineering, local curiosities, science oddities, creator phenomena and unexpected everyday stories.
- The wildcard must pass the SAME freshness, two-independent-source, claim-coherence, duplicate, visual and Growth thresholds as every other candidate.
- Never force a wildcard when the evidence or quality is weaker than the existing gates.
- The wildcard remains subject to the non-sexual brand-safety boundary above.
